<h3>Where did I try Khao Soy Soup for the first time?</h3>
<p>In Northern Thailand, in the city of Chiang Rai, I stumbled upon a hole-in-the-wall serving this delicious soup.
    The aromas of this rich and creamy dish aroused my attention. For $3 a bowl, the cook served me a bowl of Khao Soy
    with all the ingredients. It was love at first bite.

<h4>Steps</h4>
