<h3>Where Did I Try Katsu Curry for the First Time?</h3>
    <p>When I was traveling through Japan, I made the city of Osaka my jumping-off point for other nearby towns. For this dish, I made my way to Nara. Nara was home to the beautiful, grand temple complex called Todai-Ji. After exploring the temple and the surrounding areas, I headed towards a restaurant famously known for having one of the best Katsu Curry dishes in Nara. I decided to omit the shrimp that usually comes with this dish because, at the time, I wasn’t sure how big the serving was going to be. It was one of my favorite meals I had the pleasure to eat during my trip to Japan!</p>
